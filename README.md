# Nasal-Voice-Detection
Hypernasality is a resonance disorder seen in children and adults. A hypernasal
voice is produced when too much air escapes through the nose while speaking. Some
of the cases of hypernasality can only be cured with surgery. However there are also
many cases that are curable with speech therapy. This disorder can be diagnosed either
by a special device that called the nasality microphone where the resonance of the nasal
and oral area are compared, or by a professional that listens to the speech of the patient.
The aim of this study is to do the analysis of detecting nasal voices automatically with
the help of deep learning techniques and help children with hypernasality to improve
their normal speaking voice, with the help of a game.
